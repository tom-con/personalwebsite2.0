When I was 11, my family and I moved to the DC/Baltimore area where I stayed until going to <a href="http://www.psu.edu/">Penn State University</a>                        in 2009, studying <a href="http://hhd.psu.edu/shm">Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management</a>. After about 3.5 years I realized I wasn't having much fun, so I took two years off. During that time I worked in restaurants
                        as a manager. I moved to Boulder, CO in 2014 and managed two restaurants on 16th and Pearl st., <a href="http://ajirestaurant.com/">Aji Latin American Restaurant</a> and <a href="http://leafvegetarianrestaurant.com/">Leaf Vegitarian Restaurant</a>.
                        In August of 2014 I joined <a href="http://www.naropa.edu/">Naropa University</a> and decided to study Buddhist Psychology and Intercultural Communication. During my time at Naropa, I studied abroad in the small himalayan kingdom
                        of Bhutan twice, which became a pivotal experience in my life. During that time I met my wife, Kencho who now lives with me in Longmont.</p>

                        bike on trails around Boulder, Denver, Breckenridge, and Winter Park (I especially love downhilling in the summer here). I have played video games since I was really young, and therefore still do! I like <em>all</em> types of games,
                        but especially those with rich stories, game mechanics, or multiplayer aspects. I also like to read, especially books by authors with whom I don't share a cultural background so that I can learn more about different perspectives.
